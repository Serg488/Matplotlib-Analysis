# Matplotlib-Analysis
In this pharmaceutical study as a senior data analyst i will take upon examining the data of 249 mouse that have SCC tumors within the timeframe of 45 days. Using different treatments, i will be creating visualizations of the effectiveness of each treatment by comparing the size of tumor throughout treatment process. During analysis the data shows a duplicated mouse that needed to be removed, then was able to get the average tumor volume for each treatment mouse.With the mouse gender almost being even values of 50.4% male and 49.6% female, caculations were made to identify potential outliers. Visualizing the data in a boxplot graph we were able to see the outlier in Infubinol. Capomulin treatment was plotted in a line graph and showed to be the most effective treatment lowering the tumor size the most over the 45 days. Lastly we caculated a correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume being 0.84
